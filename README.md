# diary

I am a very lazy person，
But a Successful people always have a dream. 
They dream big dreams and then display great courage to do things that others say cannot be done.
Make a small target
I spent the entire day trying to write—to no avail—when my time would’ve been better spent simply reading or doing something else I enjoy
Write something every day
